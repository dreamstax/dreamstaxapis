# Dreamstax APIs

This repository contains the interface definitions for Dreamstax APIs that support both REST and gRPC protocols. Reading the original interface definitions can provide a better understanding of Dreamstax APIs and help you to utilize them more efficiently. You can also use these definitions with open source tools to generate client libraries, documentation, and other artifiacts.

## Acknowledgements
The structure and overall usage of the APIs and this repo even is largely based on [Google's API design guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design) as well as the build process around [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis)
